This repository contains the code to calculate cutpoints and segregating subjects based on the RNA-Seq expression from the BEAT-AML dataset (https://registry.opendata.aws/beataml/).
For convenience, a consolidated dataset containing the clinical and genewise-scaled expression datasets (clinical_BEAT.csv) to use alongside the code.
Survival plots are also created for each gene analyzed.
